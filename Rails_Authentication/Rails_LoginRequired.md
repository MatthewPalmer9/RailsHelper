# Login Required

## Overview

Sometimes you want to require that a user is logged in to access a route. Here's how.

## Objectives

1.  Restrict a route to logged in users.
2.  Skip a filter for particular controller actions.

## First pass: manual checks

Let's say we have a `DocumentsController`. Its `show` method looks like this:

```ruby
def show
  @document = Document.find(params[:id])
end
```

Now let's add a new requirement: documents should only be shown to users when
they're logged in. From a technical perspective, what does it actually mean for
a user to _log in_? When a user logs in, all we are doing is using cookies to add
their `:user_id` to their `session`.

The first thing you might do is to just add some code into `DocumentsController#show`:

```ruby
def show
  return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
  @document = Document.find(params[:id])
end
```

The first line is a return guard. Unless the session includes `:user_id`, we
return an error. `head(:forbidden)` is a controller method that returns the
specified HTTP status code—in this case, if a user isn't logged in, we return
`403 Forbidden`.

## Refactor

This code works fine, so you use it in a few places. Now your
DocumentsController looks like this:

```ruby
class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
    @document = Document.find(params[:id])
  end

  def index
    return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
  end

  def create
    return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
    @document = Document.create(author_id: user_id)
  end

  def update
    return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
    @document = Document.find(params[:id])
    # code to update a document
  end
end
```

That doesn't look so DRY. I really wish there were a way to ask Rails to run a
check before any controller action.

Fortunately, Rails gives us a solution: [`before_action`][filters]. We can
refactor our code like so:

```ruby
class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_login

  def show
    @document = Document.find(params[:id])
  end

  def index
  end

  def create
    @document = Document.create(author_id: user_id)
  end

  private

  def require_login
    return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
  end
end
```

Let's look at the code we've added:

```ruby
before_action :require_login
```

This is a call to the ActionController class method `before_action`.
`before_action` registers a filter. A filter is a method which runs before,
after, or around, a controller's action. In this case, the filter runs before
all DocumentsController's actions, and kicks requests out with `403 Forbidden`
unless they're logged in.

## Skipping filters for certain actions

What if we wanted to let anyone see a list of documents, but keep the
`before_action` filter for other `DocumentsController` methods? We could do
this:

```ruby
class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_login
  skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:index]

  # ...
end
```

This class method,

```ruby
skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:index]
```

Tells Rails to skip the `require_login` filter only on the `index` action.
