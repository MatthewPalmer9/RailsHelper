# RailsHelper
A repository to keep personal notes for myself about Ruby on Rails (RoR). Notes have been separated into individual `.md` files by concern.
**VISITORS:** If you have stumbled upon this repository, please utilize it as you see fit. This repository is updated on a random basis with new information that I deem important. With that said, **the status for this repository of RoR educational information is to be understood as INCOMPLETE until further notice.**

**DISCLAIMER: THIS REPOSITORY WILL NOT TEACH YOU THE BASIC OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS NEEDED TO USE RUBY ON RAILS. PLEASE USE WITH PRIOR EXPERIENCE ON YOUR BELT. WHEN IN DOUBT, GOOGLE THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.**

## How To Start a New Rails
type `rails new app-name` in your terminal, assuming you have the appropriate gem dependencies bundled/installed.
