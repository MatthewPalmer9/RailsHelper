## Lesson

### has_many, through

Let's say you're making a blog and want to give users the ability to sign up and comment on your posts. What's the relationship between a post and a comment?  If you said, "A comment belongs to a post, and a post has many comments," give yourself a pat on the back!

What about the relationship between a user and a comment? Again, a user has many comments, and a comment belongs to the user. So far, this is pretty straightforward.

Things get slightly more complicated when we talk about the relationship between a user and the posts that the user has commented on. How would you describe that relationship? Well, a user obviously can comment on many posts, and a post has comments from many users. Yep, this is a many to many relationship. We can set up a many-to-many relationship using a join table. In this case, `comments` will act as our join table. Any table that contains two foreign keys can be thought of as a join table.  A row in our `comments` table will look something like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> id </td>
    <td> content </td>
    <td> post_id </td>
    <td> user_id </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td> 1 </td>
    <td> "I loved this post!" </td>
    <td> 5 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For this instance, we know that the `Comment` with an ID of `1` was created by the `User` with an ID of `3` for the `Post` with an ID of `5`. We have all of the information we need to determine all of the posts that a particular user has commented on as well as all of the users who commented on any post. When we're done, we'll be able to simply call `@user.posts` to get a collection of all of those posts.

Let's set this up. First, we'll need migrations for `comments`, `posts`, and `users` tables. We've included migrations and models in this repo, so you can follow along.

```ruby
# db/migrate/xxx_create_posts

class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :content
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# db/migrate/xxx_create_users

class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
   def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :username
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# db/migrate/xxx_create_comments

class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.string :content
      t.belongs_to :user
      t.belongs_to :post
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

In our models, we have the following:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments
  has_many :users, through: :comments
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments
  has_many :posts, through: :comments
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :post
end
```

Notice that we can't just declare that our `User` `has_many :posts` because our `posts` table doesn't have a foreign key called `user_id`. Instead, we tell Active Record to look through the `comments` table to figure out this association by declaring that our `User` `has_many :posts, through: :comments`. Now, instances of our `User` model respond to a method called `posts`. This will return a collection of posts that share a comment with the user.

### Displaying Comments on Our Posts

Now that our association is set up, let's display some data. First, let's set up our `Post#show` page to display all of the comments on a particular post. We'll include the username of the user who created the comment as well as a link to their show page.

In `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`, define a `show` action that finds a particular post to make it available for display.

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

class PostsController < ApplicationController

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

In our `Post#show` page, we'll display the title and content information for the post as well as the information for each comment associated with the post.

```erb
# app/views/posts/show.html.erb

<h2><%= @post.title %></h2>
<p>
  Content: <%= @post.content %>
</p>
Comments:
  <% @post.comments.each do |comment| %>
    <%= link_to comment.user.username, user_path(comment.user) %> said
    <%= comment.content %>
  <% end %>
```

This is the same as we've done before –– we're simply looking at data associated with posts and comments. Calling `comment.user` returns for us the `User` object associated with that comment. We can then call any method that our user responds to, such as `username`.

## Adding Posts to Our Users

Let's say that on our `User#show` page we want our users to see a list of all of the posts that they've commented on. What would that look like?

Because we've set up a join model, the interface will look almost identical. We can simply call the `posts` method on our user and iterate through.

```erb
# app/views/users/show.html.erb

<h2><%= @user.username %> </h2> has commented on the following posts:

<% @user.posts.each do |post| %>
  <%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %>
<% end %>
```
